Lazy way of storing static scripts and binaries for various projects to use.
This project enables me to control the asset's link and ensures that it doesn't get taken down.
Additionally, since it is on Github, files will be accessible even if my web servers are down -- prevents awkward situations where the build environment depends on the services it is building.
